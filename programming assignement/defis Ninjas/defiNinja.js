// Question 1 : How would you get the character to move up?

// Ansewr 1 : 
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// To change the direction of the character,
// we change the variables from right to left and from north to south

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Question 2 : The character can currently go everywhere, 
//              even where leftValue is negative or topValue is negative. 
//              How would you adjust the code above so that the character stays between 0 to 500 
//              for both the leftValue and the topValue variables? 


// Ansewr 2 : 
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//  leftvalue  :   add the condition to move and to stop between [0 .. 500]
//  topvalue   :   add the condition to move and to stop between [0 .. 500]
